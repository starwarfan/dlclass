    "\n",
    "(in order from least complex/expensive investment to most)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Load and use a pretrained model\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the existing toolkit projects offer models pretrained on datasets, including\n",
    "* natural language corpus models\n",
    "* image datasets like ImageNet (http://www.image-net.org/) or Google's Open Image Dataset (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/introducing-open-images-dataset.html)\n",
    "* video datasets like the YouTube 8 million video dataset (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/announcing-youtube-8m-large-and-diverse.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] Augmenting a pretrained model with new training data, or using it in a related context (see Transfer Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "[3] Use a known, established network type (topology) but train on your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "[4] Modify established network models for your specific problem\n",
    "\n",
    "[5] Research and experiment with new types of models\n",
    "\n",
    "__Just because Google DeepMind, Facebook, and Microsoft are getting press for doing a lot of new research doesn't mean you have to do it too.__\n",

    "\n",
    "Data science and machine learning is challenging in general for enterprises (though some industries, such as pharma, have been doing it for a long time). Deep learning takes that even further, since deep learning experiments may require new kinds of hardware ... in some ways, it's more like chemistry than the average IT project!"

    "#### Data Munging\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the deep learning toolkits are focused on model-building performance or flexibility, less on production data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Google recently introduced `tf.Transform`, a data processing pipeline project: https://github.com/tensorflow/transform\n",
