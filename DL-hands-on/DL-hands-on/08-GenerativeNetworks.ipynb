    "\n",
    "<h3>*Concept:*<br/><br/>\n",
    "If a set of network weights can convert an image of the numeral 8 or a cat\n",
    "<br/>into the classification \"8\" or \"cat\" ... </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does it contain enough information to do the reverse?\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e., can we ask a network what \"8\" looks like and get a picture?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about this for a second. Clearly the classifications have far fewer bits of entropy than the source images' theoretical limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cat (in cat-vs-dog) has just 1 bit, where perhaps a 256x256 grayscale image has up to 512k bits.\n",
    "* 8 (in MNIST) has ${log _2 10}$ or a little over 3 bits, where a 28x28 grayscale image has over 6000 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "So at first, this would seem difficult or impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "__But__ ... let's do a thought experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Children can do this easily\n",
    "* We could create a lookup table of, say, digit -> image trivially, and use that as a first approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Those approaches seem like cheating. But let's think about how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a child (or adult) draws a cat (or number 8), they are probably not drawing any specific cat (or 8). They are drawing a general approximation of a cat based on \n",
    "1. All of the cats they've seen\n",
    "2. What they remember as the key elements of a cat (4 legs, tail, pointy ears)\n",
    "3. A lookup table substitutes one specific cat or 8 ... and, especially in the case of the 8, that may be fine. The only thing we \"lose\" is the diversity of things that all mapped to cat (or 8) -- and discarding that information was exactly our goal when building a classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"8\" is even simpler: we learn that a number is an idea, not a specific instance, so anything that another human recognizes as 8 is good enough. We are not even trying to make a particular shape, just one that represents our encoded information that distinguishes 8 from other possible symbols in the context and the eye of the viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should remind you a bit of the KL Divergence we talked about at the start: we are providing just enough information (entropy or surprise) to distinguish the cat or \"8\" from the other items that a human receiver might be expecting to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "And where do our handwritten \"pixels\" come from? No image in particular -- they are totally synthetic based on a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*These considerations make it sound more likely that a computer could perform the same task.*\n",
    "\n",
    "But what would the weights really represent? what could they generate?\n",
    "\n",
    "__The weights we learn in classification represent the distinguishing features of a class, across all training examples of the class, modified to overlap minimally with features of other classes.__ KL divergence again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be concrete, if we trained a model on just a few dozen MNIST images using pixels, it would probably learn the 3 or 4 \"magic\" pixels that *happened* to distinguish the 8s in that dataset. Trying to generate from that information would yield strong confidence about those magic pixels, but would look like dots to us humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we trained on a very large number of MNIST images -- say we use the convnet this time -- the model's weights should represent general filters of masks for features that distinguish an 8. And if we try to reverse the process by amplifying just those filters, we should get a blurry statistical distribution of those very features. The approximate shape of the Platonic \"8\"!"

    "## Mechanically, How Could This Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simpler model called an auto-encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder's job is to take a large representation of a record and find weights that represent that record in a smaller encoding, subject to the constraint that the decoded version should match the original as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit like training a JPEG encoder to compress images by scoring it with the loss between the original image and the decompressed version of the lossy compressed image.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oTRvlB6.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice aspect of this is that it is *unsupervised* -- i.e., we do not need any ground-truth or human-generated labels in order to find the error and train. The error is always the difference between the output and the input, and the goal is to minimize this over many examples, thus minimize in the general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this with a simple multilayer perceptron network. Or, we can get fancier and do this with a convolutional network. In reverse, the convolution (typically called \"transposed convolution\" or \"deconvolution\") is an upsampling operation across space (in images) or space & time (in audio/video).\n",

One way of thinking about the multivariate Gaussian representation is that VAEs are trained to find some \"meaning\" in variation along each dimensin.
