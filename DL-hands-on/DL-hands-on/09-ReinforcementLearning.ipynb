    "__In reinforcement learning, an agent takes multiple actions, and the subsequent positive or negative outcome of those actions serves as a loss function for subsequent training.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training an Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "How is training an agent different from training the models we've used so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most things stay the same, and we can use all of the knowledge we've built:\n",
    "* We can use any or all of the network models, including feed-forward, convolutional, recurrent, and combinations of those.\n",
    "* We will still train in batches using some variant of gradient descent\n",
    "* As before, the model will ideally learn a complex non-obvious function of many parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things change ... well, not really change, but \"specialize\":\n",
    "* The inputs may start out as entire frames (or frame deltas) of a video feed\n",
    "    * We may feature engineer more explicitly (or not)\n",
    "* The ouputs may be a low-cardinality set of categories that represent actions (e.g., direction of a digital joystick, or input to a small number of control systems)\n",
    "* We may model state explicitly (outside the network) as well as implicitly (inside the network)\n",
    "* The function we're learning is one which will \"tell our agent what to do\" or -- assuming there is no disconnect between knowing what to do and doing it, the function will essentially be the agent\n",
    "* __The loss function depends on the outcome of the game, and the game requires many actions to reach an outcome, and so requires some slightly different approaches from the ones we've used before.__\n",

    "### Principal Approaches: Deep Q-Learning and Policy Gradient Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deep Q-Learning is more fundamental and widely used, and we'll look at it first.\n",
    "* Policy Gradient is state-of-the-art as of 2016 and shows a lot of promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, many variants on these as well as some other strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Q-Learning is deep learning applied to \"Q-Learning.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is Q-Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning is a model that posits a map for optimal actions for each possible state in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given a state and an action, there is a \"Q-function\" that provides the value or quality (the Q stands for quality) of that action taken in that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if an agent is in state s, choosing an action could be as simple as looking at Q(s, a) for all a, and choosing the highest \"quality value\" -- aka ${\\underset{a \\in A}{\\operatorname{arg max}}Q(s,a)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other considerations, such as explore-exploit tradeoff, but let's focus on this Q function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In small state spaces, this function can be represented as a table, a bit like basic strategy blackjack tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rfxLSls.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a simple Atari-style video game may have hundreds of thousands of states, though. This is where the neural network comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What we need is a way to learn a Q function, when we don't know what the error of a particular move is, since the error (loss) may be dependent on many future actions and can also be non-deterministic (e.g., if there are randomly generated enemies or conditions in the game).__\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricks -- or insights -- here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Model the total future reward -- what we're really after -- as a recursive calculation from the immediate reward (*r*) and future outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${Q(s,a)=r + \\gamma max_{a’}Q(s’,a’)}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "* ${\\gamma}$ is a \"discount factor\" on future reward\n",
    "* Assume the game terminates or \"effectively terminates\" to make the recursion tractable\n",
    "* This equation is a simplified case of the Bellman Equation\n",
    "    \n",
    "[2] Assume that if you iteratively run this process starting with an arbitrary Q model, and you train the Q model with actual outcomes, your Q model will eventually converge toward the \"true\" Q function\n",
    "* This resembles Gibbs sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As improbable as this might seem at first for teaching an agent a complex game or task, it actually works, and in a straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we apply this to our neural network code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike before, when we called \"fit\" to train a network automatically, here we'll need some interplay between the agent's behavior in the game and the training. That is, we need the agent to play some moves in order to get actual numbers to train with. And as soon as we have some actual numbers, we want to do a little training with them right away so that our Q function improves. So we'll alternate one or more in-game actions with a manual call to train on a single batch of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm looks like this (credit for the nice summary to Tambet Matiisen; read his longer explanation at https://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/ for review):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do a feedforward pass for the current state s to get predicted Q-values for all actions.\n",
    "2. Do a feedforward pass for the next state s′ and calculate maximum over all network outputs $max_{a’}Q(s’,a’)$\n",
    "3. Set Q-value target for action a to $r+\\gamma max_{a’}Q(s’,a’)$ (use the max calculated in step 2). For all other actions, set the Q-value target to the same as originally returned from step 1, making the error 0 for those outputs.\n",
    "4. Update the weights using backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is \"reward\" throughout the game, we can model the loss as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$L=\\frac{1}{2}[\\underbrace{r + \\gamma max_{a'}Q(s',a')}_{\\text{target}} - \\underbrace{Q(s,a)}_{\\text{prediction}}]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the game is win/lose only ... most of the r's go away and the entire loss is based on a 0/1 or -1/1 score at the end of a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Consideration 1: Experience Replay\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve training, we cache all (or as much as possible) of the agent's state/move/reward/next-state data. Then, when we go to perform a training run, we can build a batch out of a subset of all previous moves. This provides diversity in the training data, whose value we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Consideration 2: Explore-Exploit Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add more diversity to the agent's actions, we set a threshold (\"epsilon\") which represents the probability that the agent ignores its experience-based model and just chooses a random action. This also add diversity, by preventing the agent from taking an overly-narrow, 100% greedy (best-perfomance-so-far) path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's Look at the Code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning code examples are a bit more complex than the other examples we've seen so far, because in the other examples, the data sets (training and test) exist outside the program as assets (e.g., the MNIST digit data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the training and reward data come from some environment that the agent is supposed to learn. Typically, the environment is simulated by local code, or *represented by local code* even if the real environment is remote or comes from the physical world via sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So the code contains not just the neural net and training logic, but part (or all) of a game world itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most elegant small, but complete, examples comes courtesy of Ph.D. researcher Eder Santana at Univ. of Florida. It's a simplified catch-the-falling-brick game (a bit like Atari Kaboom! but even simpler) that nevertheless is complex enough to illustrate DQL and to be impressive in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the entire script in the terminal (`dql1.py1` to train the model, `dql-test.py` to test it and generate gameplay images; the images can be assembled into a video using ffmpeg as discussed on Mr. Santana's gist at https://gist.github.com/EderSantana/c7222daa328f0e885093)\n",

    "Some of these challenges come down to the *credit assignment problem* -- properly attributing reward to actions in the past which may (or may not) be responsible for the reward -- and thus some mitigations include more complex reward functions, adding more frequent reward training into the system, and adding domain knowledge to the policy, or adding an entire separate network, called a \"critic network\" to learn to provide feedback to the actor network.\n",

    "PG is challenging to use in practice, though there are a number of \"tricks\" in various publications that you can try.\n",
